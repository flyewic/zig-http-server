very simple multi-threaded HTTP-server written in zig from scratch.

you can download the binary from the releases tab or build from source.

if downloading binary: make sure you also have a config.json next to the binary with the correct values. A ready-to-go config is in the github and can be used or modified.

if building from source: I have been using Zig 0.15.1 so previous versions may struggle.

the code is provided as is, please don't use it, it's really bad and only meant as a learning project.
